# How I "doubled" my battery life

Most Android OEMs come bundled with a __TON__ of bloatware. For example, I don't use _most_ of the google suite so I tend to delete almost all of the google apps that come pre-installed with my device.

# Some Background

I use a [Samsung Galaxy S23](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s23-12082.php) as my main device, so on top of coming in with some of the google apps _such as their frankly awful browser and assistant I only ever used for music recognition_, it also came in with a bunch of Samsung bloatware such as Bixby, the "modes & routines" which require __WAY__ too many permissions for me to trust, I ended up trying some of the features and realizing that I, personally, could live without them.

So I decided to uninstall them, I tried finding them in the app drawer, but the uninstall button was greyed out or it wasn't even appearing like the image below.

# The Solution

The [universal android debloater](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation)! (next generation) or UAD-NG for short.

_The "next generation" part means the bloatware lists are updated._

What this app allows me to do is - using adb, delete a __TON__ of the bloatware and extra garbage that I won't be using, as well as removing some literal spyware that comes pre-installed with my Android OEM OneUI.

# The aftermath

I've been able to increase my battery life a LOT by simply removing a ton of the bloatware that comes pre-installed, I can use any browser I want because I can effectively uninstall chrome and set another app as my default browser, I went from __6 hours__ of Screen On Time (SOT) to around __8 hours__, which is a BIG difference for me.
