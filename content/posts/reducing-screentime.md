# Reducing Screen time

## Introduction

I usually have the [Digital Wellbeing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_US&gl=US) app set up to send me a notification every week that essentially summarizes my screen time that week, informing me of what apps I used the most as well as how long I used them, my peak usage times, my daily average screen time for the week and worst of all, **all** of my screen time _combined_, as you can see here.

# The problem

If you too feel like you're using your phone too much you can follow along this guide to try and _minimize_ your screen time and only use your phone for when it's _ultimately needed_, for example when you need to look something up on the internet, text or call someone.

As I've mentioned in a previous blog post, I use a [Samsung Galaxy S23](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s23-12082.php) as my main device, so the following instructions I provide will be catered towards [OneUI 6.0](https://www.samsung.com/in/one-ui/features/) and above.

## Attachment

One of the main reasons as to why we are all so **attached** to our devices is the loss of contact we usually had with someone or a multitude of people we're texting all the time or maybe we're addicted to 'scrolling feeds' such as TikTok and Instagram Reels, whatever the reason, I will try to help you out in this guide to reduce your screen time as much as possible without feeling like you're distancing yourself from the world.

# The solution

Now that we have that out of the way, there are a few steps we can take to reduce screen time:
- Taking color out of the picture _(I've noticed color being one of the main ways applications tend to grab your attention)_
- Minimizing notifications _(Don't worry, we're not straight up **turning them off**)_
- Making the attention grabbing apps harder to reach
- (OPTIONAL) Using external apps to help block your device at certain periods of time.

It sounds like a lot but believe me, it's pretty simple.

## Taking color out of the picture

Enabling grayscale mode on your device, your milage may vary with this, most devices support it as far as I'm aware, here's how to do it on your samsung phone.

## Minimizing notifications

There's a LOT of ways to minimize notifications, I'm using an app called [BuzzKill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.buzzkill), but it _does cost $3_.

For some free alternatives you could try [FilterBox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catchingnow.np) and [Nap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catchingnow.np), I however have never used these and I suggest looking into them to see if they suit your needs.

What I like to do is set up a rule in BuzzKill that groups my notifications, so it bundles them up and batch sends them every 2 hours, and then set up a rule so that all of my favorite contacts and some of my apps get notifications delievered on time.

## Making the attention grabbing apps harder to reach

The best way to do this is to just remove them from your home screen, you can also try experimenting with some custom launchers, I use the [Niagara Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher) as my main launcher and have a super minimal setup to try and make the attention grabbing apps pretty hard to reach, as I'd have to manually search for them and then open them.

## Using external apps to help block your device

If you're really struggling and still find yourself addicted to your device after all of this, you can straight up set a timer to block it entirely.

I've never really needed to use this but the app [blockit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hypenet.focused) has a super intuitive and nice UI and overall does a good job.

# Conclusion

And there you have it, the ways I minimize my screen time and keep myself from spiraling out of control, I will update this post with an image of my digital wellbeing stats after the end of the week.
