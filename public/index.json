For example, I don\u0026rsquo;t use most of the google suite so I tend to delete almost all of the google apps that come pre-installed with my device.\nSome Background I use a Samsung Galaxy S23 as my main device, so on top of coming in with some of the google apps such as their frankly awful browser and assistant I only ever used for music recognition, it also came in with a bunch of Samsung bloatware such as Bixby, the \u0026ldquo;modes \u0026amp; routines\u0026rdquo; which require WAY too many permissions for me to trust, I ended up trying some of the features and realizing that I, personally, could live without them.\nSo I decided to uninstall them, I tried finding them in the app drawer, but the uninstall button was greyed out or it wasn\u0026rsquo;t even appearing like the image below.\nThe Solution The universal android debloater! (next generation) or UAD-NG for short.\nThe \u0026ldquo;next generation\u0026rdquo; part means the bloatware lists are updated.\nWhat this app allows me to do is - using adb, delete a TON of the bloatware and extra garbage that I won\u0026rsquo;t be using, as well as removing some literal spyware that comes pre-installed with my Android OEM OneUI.\nThe aftermath I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to increase my battery life a LOT by simply removing a ton of the bloatware that comes pre-installed, I can use any browser I want because I can effectively uninstall chrome and set another app as my default browser, I went from 6 hours of Screen On Time (SOT) to around 8 hours, which is a BIG difference for me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/double-battery-life/","summary":"How I \u0026ldquo;doubled\u0026rdquo; my battery life Most Android OEMs come bundled with a TON of bloatware.
