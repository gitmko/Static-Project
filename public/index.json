[{"content":"Reducing Screen time Introduction I usually have the Digital Wellbeing app set up to send me a notification every week that essentially summarizes my screen time that week, informing me of what apps I used the most as well as how long I used them, my peak usage times, my daily average screen time for the week and worst of all, all of my screen time combined, as you can see here.\nThe problem If you too feel like you\u0026rsquo;re using your phone too much you can follow along this guide to try and minimize your screen time and only use your phone for when it\u0026rsquo;s ultimately needed, for example when you need to look something up on the internet, text or call someone.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in a previous blog post, I use a Samsung Galaxy S23 as my main device, so the following instructions I provide will be catered towards OneUI 6.0 and above.\nAttachment One of the main reasons as to why we are all so attached to our devices is the loss of contact we usually had with someone or a multitude of people we\u0026rsquo;re texting all the time or maybe we\u0026rsquo;re addicted to \u0026lsquo;scrolling feeds\u0026rsquo; such as TikTok and Instagram Reels, whatever the reason, I will try to help you out in this guide to reduce your screen time as much as possible without feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re distancing yourself from the world.\nThe solution Now that we have that out of the way, there are a few steps we can take to reduce screen time:\nTaking color out of the picture (I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed color being one of the main ways applications tend to grab your attention) Minimizing notifications (Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we\u0026rsquo;re not straight up turning them off) Making the attention grabbing apps harder to reach (OPTIONAL) Using external apps to help block your device at certain periods of time. It sounds like a lot but believe me, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple.\nTaking color out of the picture Enabling grayscale mode on your device, your milage may vary with this, most devices support it as far as I\u0026rsquo;m aware, here\u0026rsquo;s how to do it on your samsung phone.\nMinimizing notifications There\u0026rsquo;s a LOT of ways to minimize notifications, I\u0026rsquo;m using an app called BuzzKill, but it does cost $3.\nFor some free alternatives you could try FilterBox and Nap, I however have never used these and I suggest looking into them to see if they suit your needs.\nWhat I like to do is set up a rule in BuzzKill that groups my notifications, so it bundles them up and batch sends them every 2 hours, and then set up a rule so that all of my favorite contacts and some of my apps get notifications delievered on time.\nMaking the attention grabbing apps harder to reach The best way to do this is to just remove them from your home screen, you can also try experimenting with some custom launchers, I use the Niagara Launcher as my main launcher and have a super minimal setup to try and make the attention grabbing apps pretty hard to reach, as I\u0026rsquo;d have to manually search for them and then open them.\nUsing external apps to help block your device If you\u0026rsquo;re really struggling and still find yourself addicted to your device after all of this, you can straight up set a timer to block it entirely.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never really needed to use this but the app blockit has a super intuitive and nice UI and overall does a good job.\nConclusion And there you have it, the ways I minimize my screen time and keep myself from spiraling out of control, I will update this post with an image of my digital wellbeing stats after the end of the week.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/reducing-screentime/","summary":"Reducing Screen time Introduction I usually have the Digital Wellbeing app set up to send me a notification every week that essentially summarizes my screen time that week, informing me of what apps I used the most as well as how long I used them, my peak usage times, my daily average screen time for the week and worst of all, all of my screen time combined, as you can see here.","title":"Reducing Screen time"},{"content":"How I \u0026ldquo;doubled\u0026rdquo; my battery life FUCK YEA Most Android OEMs come bundled with a TON of bloatware. For example, I don\u0026rsquo;t use most of the google suite so I tend to delete almost all of the google apps that come pre-installed with my device.\nSome Background I use a Samsung Galaxy S23 as my main device, so on top of coming in with some of the google apps such as their frankly awful browser and assistant I only ever used for music recognition, it also came in with a bunch of Samsung bloatware such as Bixby, the \u0026ldquo;modes \u0026amp; routines\u0026rdquo; which require WAY too many permissions for me to trust, I ended up trying some of the features and realizing that I, personally, could live without them.\nSo I decided to uninstall them, I tried finding them in the app drawer, but the uninstall button was greyed out or it wasn\u0026rsquo;t even appearing like the image below.\nThe Solution The universal android debloater! (next generation) or UAD-NG for short.\nThe \u0026ldquo;next generation\u0026rdquo; part means the bloatware lists are updated.\nWhat this app allows me to do is - using adb, delete a TON of the bloatware and extra garbage that I won\u0026rsquo;t be using, as well as removing some literal spyware that comes pre-installed with my Android OEM OneUI.\nThe aftermath I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to increase my battery life a LOT by simply removing a ton of the bloatware that comes pre-installed, I can use any browser I want because I can effectively uninstall chrome and set another app as my default browser, I went from 6 hours of Screen On Time (SOT) to around 8 hours, which is a BIG difference for me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/double-battery-life/","summary":"How I \u0026ldquo;doubled\u0026rdquo; my battery life FUCK YEA Most Android OEMs come bundled with a TON of bloatware.
